# Your Name

Hey, I'm a student at [**Oxford University**](https://www.ox.ac.uk). I enjoy solving problems and making everything prettier! My website is still in development, so please forgive me for the bugs :,)

I love ice skating,  karaoke, dancing(horribly), photography, digital drawing, cats, miniskirts, learning japanese, 凉菜, the ocean, cosplaying, kuromi, card games. (in no particular order)

I have a love-hate relationship with coding. Recently, I participated in [**EGOI**](https://wwwdontmesswith6a.blogspot.com/2023/07/egoi-2023-singapore-team-results.html) in Sweden, and before that I was awarded with Top Female Medalist in [**NOI**](https://noisg.comp.nus.edu.sg/noi/noiTwentySixResults.php#section3) in 2023. 
working on machine learning at [ASTAR's](https://www.a-star.edu.sg) [BII](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii):
piqued my interest in this field, and I have taken several online courses, and obtained a [**certification**](https://google.accredible.com/7a4afa65-96a1-431a-a75c-258e95a19d1a) from Google!

My family is in <a href="https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/hongkong">Hong Kong</a> and China, but I call Singapore home as I have spent most of my life there. (click on the countries to check out my experiences in each of them!)
I enjoy exploring different cities, and I have travelled to 
- the US(San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas), 
- Japan(Tokyo, Kyoto, Sapporo, Otaru, Niseko), 
- Taiwan, 
- England(Oxford, Manchester, London), 
- Denmark, 
- Sweden, 
- Malaysia, 
- Indonesia(Batam, Bali), 
- Vietnam, 
- Cambodia, 
- Thailand. 
- (with layovers in Dubai, Cairo, Hungary)

(I hope I will have time to do write-ups about each of them because I have a lot to talk about!!)

I hope to visit (this is also in no particular order)
- Sweden (didnt get enough at EGOI)
- the Netherlands
- the Alps (skiing!)
- Kyoto again!! and Okinawa
- Korea! (the art and food)
- East Coast of US (my friends in college there!)
