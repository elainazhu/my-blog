I study Computer Science at [Magdalen College](https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk), Oxford. 

Currently in travelling, this summer I could be doing hongkong/ singapore/ new york/ london/ italy/ spain.
In summer 2025, I was at Harvest Global Investments in Hong Kong, where I investigated digital assets, particularly tokenised real-world assets and REITs for trading. 
In summer 2024 I was at [Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT)](https://www.quantumlah.org), where wrote a paper examining quantum neural networks.
I also wrote [**this**](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_post-variational_quantum_neural_networks/) demo for [pennylane](https://pennylane.ai).
At CQT, I worked on using CNNs to improve quantum chip design, and exploring new techniques for quantum machine learning as well.

I did ML at [ASTAR's](https://www.a-star.edu.sg) [BII](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii). (research poster in <a href = "https://elainazhu.com/photos"> photos</a>)

I do competitive programming, I participated in [EGOI](https://wwwdontmesswith6a.blogspot.com/2023/07/egoi-2023-singapore-team-results.html) in Sweden, and before that I was awarded with Gold Medal and Top Female Medalist in [NOI](https://noisg.comp.nus.edu.sg/noi/noiTwentySixResults.php#section3).

Sometimes I have thoughts about [my family](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/family), I like to listen to [music](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/songs).

I like ice skating, karaoke, dancing, photography, digital drawing, cats, miniskirts, learning japanese, 凉菜, the ocean, cosplaying, kuromi, card games.

My family is in [Hong Kong](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/hongkong) and China, but I call Singapore home. I [travel](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/travel) sometimes.
