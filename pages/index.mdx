I'm working at [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org), writing [**this**](https://qml-build-previews.pennylane.ai/pull_request_build_preview/1154/qml/demos/tutorial_post-variational_quantum_neural_networks/). Email me at elaina.zw@gmail.com for questions or comments!
I'm also working on using CNNs to improve quantum chip design, and exploring new methods for quantum machine learning.

I did machine learning at [ASTAR's](https://www.a-star.edu.sg) [BII](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii). (research poster in <a href = "https://elainazhu.com/photos"> photos</a>)

I do competitive programming, I participated in [EGOI](https://wwwdontmesswith6a.blogspot.com/2023/07/egoi-2023-singapore-team-results.html) in Sweden, and before that I was awarded with Gold Medal and Top Female Medalist in [NOI](https://noisg.comp.nus.edu.sg/noi/noiTwentySixResults.php#section3).

Sometimes I have thoughts about [my family](https://elainazhu.com/pdosts_archive/family) and [boys and trading](https://animated-periwinkle-c41.notion.site/risk-appetite-0a7c00c56c0a40db84db30c8fc76ed3c).

I like ice skating, karaoke, dancing, photography, digital drawing, cats, miniskirts, learning japanese, 凉菜, the ocean, cosplaying, kuromi, card games.

My family is in [Hong Kong](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/hongkong") and China, but I call Singapore home. I [travel](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/travel) sometimes.
