adI'm working at [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org). 
I wrote a paper on tilted losses in training quantum neural networks and its now in review at ICLR. You can view the preprint [**here**](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/QCTERM).
I also wrote [**this**](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_post-variational_quantum_neural_networks/) demo.

I'm also working on using CNNs to improve quantum chip design, and exploring new techniques for quantum machine learning.

I did ML at [ASTAR's](https://www.a-star.edu.sg) [BII](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii). (research poster in <a href = "https://elainazhu.com/photos"> photos</a>)

I do competitive programming, I participated in [EGOI](https://wwwdontmesswith6a.blogspot.com/2023/07/egoi-2023-singapore-team-results.html) in Sweden, and before that I was awarded with Gold Medal and Top Female Medalist in [NOI](https://noisg.comp.nus.edu.sg/noi/noiTwentySixResults.php#section3).

Sometimes I have thoughts about [my family](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/family) and [boys and trading](https://animated-periwinkle-c41.notion.site/risk-appetite-0a7c00c56c0a40db84db30c8fc76ed3c).

I like ice skating, karaoke, dancing, photography, digital drawing, cats, miniskirts, learning japanese, 凉菜, the ocean, cosplaying, kuromi, card games.

My family is in [Hong Kong](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/hongkong) and China, but I call Singapore home. I [travel](https://elainazhu.com/posts_archive/travel) sometimes.
