description: My experience living in Hong Kong

My mother moved to hongkong to work in 2021, and I have been travelling to Hong Kong to live frequently since then. 

I the electric trams (affectionately named the 叮当车 by my family).

The gentle breeze through my hair in the always-perfect weather through the busy streets which I have a perfect view of from the 叮当车, will always be how i remember hongkong.

And of course I cant talk about Hong Kong without the food! What can I say. It is very yummy. 

This is a quaint little dimsum place below our home!
